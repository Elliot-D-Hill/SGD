# Benchmarking stochastic gradient descent

Improving stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through benchmarking experiments.

# Current experiments

Class-balanced mini-batch schemes for improving the efficiency of parameter optimization during the model training phase for classification problems with severe class imbalance.

# Future experiments

Momentum variations (coming soon).

LDS versus i.i.d. solution initialization (coming soon).
